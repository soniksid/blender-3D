This repo is about my journey of learning Blender and making low and high poly models using it. 

## About Blender

Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. You are free to use Blender for any purpose, including commercially or for education.
